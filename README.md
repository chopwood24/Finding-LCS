# Finding-LCS
To use these two programs, enter "py (name of program.py) (argument(s))" in the command line
If you enter no argument for these programs, they will automatically generate two sequences each consisting of 12 base pairs and then they will find the length of the LCS.
If you enter an integer as an argument, two random sequences of length(integer) will be generated and the length of the LCS will be calculated. 
If you enter two sequences sperated by a space, the program will calculate the length of the LCS for those two sequences.
